# Javascript-Drum-Kit / Music Player

This is a Javascript Drum Kit/Music Player inspired by Wes Bos' "Javascript 30 - 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge", which you can find here: https://javascript30.com.

It's a simple application to practice my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills from scratch. When the page is loaded, the user would be able to click their keyboard to play sounds.

**Future Updates**
- Finding public domain or recording own sounds to play when buttons are clicked.
